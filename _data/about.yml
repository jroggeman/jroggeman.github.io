- title: Hobbies
  content: Thought I do love programming, I _occasionally_ have to take breaks.
      When I'm not programming, you'll likely find me baking sweet things, attempting
      to play drums, or playing indie video games.

- title: CS Specialization
  content: Right now, my favorite area of CS is compiler design.  After implementing
      a toy compiler for a class in college, I started working on an educational
      compiler, the goal being to provide a well-constructed simple compiler as a
      learning resource.  I'm also interested in systems programming, and backend
      web development (usually with Rails).
