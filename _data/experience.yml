      dev tools team.  I contributed significantly to a new source code management

- company: Pitt
  summary: web dev
  description: Two summers ago, I worked with Dr. Labrinidis to design and implement
      a few web apps for Pitt's CS department.  Working with Laravel and Angular, I
      created an app to easily track departmental finances, an app to manage project
      deadlines for grad students, and an app that attempted to intelligently
      filter and organize tweets from a given list of users.
