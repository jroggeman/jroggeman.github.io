  summary: Take attendance using text messages!
  description: Handy is a Rails app I created my sophomore year in college as a
      way to take attendance at Computer Science Club meetings (and as an excuse
      to learn Rails).  We generate a random, unique token for each event (some
      combination of two nouns, such as <code>battle celery</code>), and have the
      club members send that token as a text to a Twilio number.

  summary: Create and manage exams.
  description: Examinatr is another Rails app I created during my senior year in college
      to manage exams for a professor.  It started as an ordinary Rails app, but has grown
      into an SPA (and an excuse to learn Ember).
