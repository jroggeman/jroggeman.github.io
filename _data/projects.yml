  summary: Take attendance using text messages!
  description: Handy is a Rails app I created my sophomore year in college as a
      way to take attendance at Computer Science Club meetings (and as an excuse
      to learn Rails).  We generate a random, unique token for each event (some
      combination of two nouns, such as <code>battle celery</code>), and have the
      club members send that token as a text to a Twilio number.

  summary: Create and manage exams.
  description: Examinatr is a Rails app I created during my senior year in college
      to manage exams for a professor.  It started as an ordinary Rails app, but has grown
      into an SPA (and an excuse to learn Ember).

  summary: An educational toy compiler
  description: At the end of a compilers course in college, we created a small compiler
      as a project, but it was rushed and rather buggy.  To get a better feel for
      compiler development and implementation, I'm creating another one with a focus
      on software quality and testing.  Ideally, I'd like to provide a useful resource
      to anybody interested in the inner workings of a compiler.

  summary: Uber for dining hall swipes
  description: As the final project for a web apps class, my team created
      a web app designed to match those with extra dining hall swipes with those that
      are looking for swipes.  Using text messages (via Twilio), those with extra
      swipes check in at a particular hall, and those looking for swipes text our
      system saying they're looking for a swipe; our system informs both users if
      they've been paired, handling a variety of edge cases.

  summary: Using ML to predict crime
  description: As the final project for a machine learning class, my team ran an experiment
      on publicly available crime data from Chicago, trying to figure out if any 
      machine learning models would be able to predict the likelihood of crime
      on a given day (using data up to the previous day).
